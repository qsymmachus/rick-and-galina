        <h3>Accommodations</h3>

        <p>
          Our wedding reception will be held at the new Hotel at Oberlin, Tappan Square.
          There are just a few rooms left in the Olmsted-Betzel block at a discounted rate 
          for Friday, May 27th and Saturday, May 28th. Please make reservations before 
          May 12th by calling (440) 775-7001, or by contacting the Director of Sales, 
          <a href="mailto:atheberge@thehotelatoberlin.com">Amanda Theberge</a> and including 
          "Olmsted-Betzel Wedding" in your email subject line. After that date, we cannot 
          guarantee availability at the hotel.

        <h3>Travel</h3>

        <p>
          Out-of-town guests should plan to fly into Cleveland Hopkins Airport. While transportation from
          the airport to Oberlin can be booked in advance (see
          <a href="https://new.oberlin.edu/visitor/transportation.dot">this page</a> for more details), a rental
          car is strongly recommended for travel to and from the airport, and for travel between Oberlin and Lorain.

          have bedtimes. For details about child care options in Oberlin, please email
          <a href="mailto:galina.olmsted@gmail.com">Galina</a>.
